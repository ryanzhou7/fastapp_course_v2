## Lesson difficulty

### ü§Ø Hard

## Introduction

The [FastAPI-template](https://github.com/s3rius/FastAPI-template) tool that generates our project requires poetry, which we need to first setup.

## Poetry setup

Poetry is like npm but for python, it has several features that pip doesn't have, install it per the [guide here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx).

First, [install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) via `$ brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`.

Then, install poetry with `$ pipx install poetry`.

## fastapi_template setup

Now that you installed poetry with pipx, install `fastapi_template` with `pipx install fastapi_template` and verify via:

`$ fastapi_template --version`

Run `$ fastapi_template --help` helpful explanations.

You are ready to create the project now. Change directory to where you like the project folder to be and run:

`$ fastapi_template -n fastapp --quiet --api-type rest --db none --orm none --ci none`

Explaiation of flags used

- `-n fastapp`: Project name
- `--quiet`: don't ask me questions for extra options
- `--api-type rest`: this is for a restful api (as opposed to graphql)
- `--db none`: don't add a database
- `--orm none`: don't add an object relational mapping like sqlalchemy
- `--ci none`: don't add continuous integration like github actions

If you see

> `Check with Ruff..........................................................Failed`

This is fine to ignore.

This is the simplest version of the project we can generate, but it is still a lot of new code, (the most amount new code seen in a single chapter, hence the ü§Ø Hard rating).

All subsequent generations with additional flags will be much be easier to understand.

## Python version selection

Like with most repos, start with reading the `README.md` file at the repo root. Return here after you finish reading the section of "Poetry" (but don't execute those commands).

It tells you to run the projects with these commands.

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m fastapp
```

But, before we do this we want to use the correct version of python, which is `3.11`.

We know this because the `Dockerfile` says so

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11.4-slim-bullseye as prod
```

This Dockerfile is how the app will run in prod, so it'd be ideal for our local dev environment to match it as close as possible.

We will learn about this Dockerfile later on.

Use mise to use python 3.11 for this project. Patch versions above `> 3.11` versions such as `3.11.15` are fine even though the Dockerfile says `python:3.11.4-slim-bullseye`. The `X` increments of `3.11.X` means that there are bug fixes and no breaking changes.

Check your version: `$ python3 --version`

If this doesn't match `3.11` you can run `source ~/.zshrc` (which reloads the configuration file) then try again, or open a new terminal tab.

## Project installation

Once your python version is correct, return to the repo `README.md` to follow it's installation instructions:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m fastapp
```

In the browser [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs) should show you swagger docs.

## Poetry vs pip

Let's learn a little more about poetry

[Poetry cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/CarlosDomingues/b88df15749af23a463148bd2c2b9b3fb) is a helpful cheat sheet.

Compare and contrast pip and poetry below

| Pip command                                             | Poetry command                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `python3 -m venv env # create a virtual environment`    | Not needed, but most similar is `poetry install`   |
| `source env/bin/activate # activate it`                 | Not needed, but most similar is `poetry shell`     |
| `pip list # show installed libs`                        | `poetry show`                                      |
| `pip install -r requirements.txt # install all recs`    | `poetry install # install all recs in poetry.lock` |
| `pip install fastapi # install one lib`                 | `poetry add fastapi`                               |
| `which python # points to the py in the activated venv` | `poetry run which python`                          |

The above table is sorted by `pip` commands you'd typically run from top to bottom. If you run the poetry commands in the same order, you will get errors because the poetry workflow is...

```bash
poetry install # create a virtual environment if one doesn't already exist and install all recs in poetry.lock
poetry show # show all installed

# "poetry run" means in the poetry virtual env, do the next command
# you'll see that the venv is not in the repo root, but this is fine
poetry run which python # Note the location

# starts a shell for which we are in the poetry created virtual environment
poetry shell
which python # matches the location above, we don't need to preface with $ poetry run anymore in the active shell
```

## Return to README.md

Return to `README.md` of the project.

- Skip reading the "Docker" section
- Give "Project structure" a glance, not to understand all of this now, but to note that it can be used as a reference
- Read "Configuration", then return here

## Fast reload

We're going to test out the fast reload by seeing which files it affects.

You currently have

```bash
# .env
FASTAPP_RELOAD=True
```

This flag is for local development, when you run `$ poetry run python -m fastapp`

Then, make this change

```python
# /web/application.py
    # ...
    # Main router for the API.
    app.include_router(router=api_router, prefix="/api")
    print("changed") # Add this
    return app
```

You'd expect to see the print and it should

However, there are exceptions to which files hot reload applies to.

Right now `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` should work.

Make this change and save the file

```python
# fastapp/settings.py
    # ...
    host: str = "127.0.0.1"
    port: int = 8001 # previously 8000
    # ...
```

In the terminal you should see the following:

> `WARNING:  WatchFiles detected changes in 'fastapp/settings.py'. Reloading...`

Does `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` still work? It should.

That is unexpected right? We changed the port from 8000 -> 8001.

Use control + c to kill the python command and run the app again.

Now `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` shouldn't work, but `http://localhost:8001/api/docs` does.

So, there are limitations to the auto-reload. But luckily, they are mostly edges cases.

The app does run on `8001` because fast reload is not smart enough to kill the app and restart it.

Test to see if `__main__.py` is also an edge case.

Solution: It is

## Debugger setup

We will now see the sequence of execution when we run the app.

This will be a bit lengthy, but worth it to understand many of the files that where just added.

We can add print statements, but it is easier / faster via the debugger.

Plus, setting up a debugger is extremely useful, as you can pause execution and see local variables at any line of code.

First find out the poetry virtual environment path with `$ poetry run which python`

For example. `/Users/<YOUR_USER>/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/fastapp-ZkIpIdmY-py3.10/bin/python`

Create a `.vscode` directory at the repo root add the following files

```json
// settings.json
{
  "python.pythonPath": "<INSERT_PATH>"
}
// ^tells vscode where our python is

// launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: run poetry", // You can name this anything
      "type": "python", // this is python type run
      "request": "launch",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}", // cwd = change working directory
      "module": "fastapp", // matches the $ python -m fastapp
      "args": [],
      "console": "integratedTerminal", // use the built in vscode terminal
      "justMyCode": false
    }
  ]
}

```

Now click in the top left and Run and Debug button, and the green run button.

The app should work as it previously did.

Look at the middle top for 6 buttons, which are:

| Action    | Icon |
| --------- | ---- |
| Continue  | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è   |
| Step Over | ‚§µ    |
| Step Into | ‚¨áÔ∏è   |
| Step Out  | üîº   |
| Restart   | ‚≠ïÔ∏è  |
| Stop      | ‚èπ    |

## Debugger breakpoints

Open `__main__.py` and click just left of the line numbers in line 1.

You should see "Click to add a breakpoint".

After clicking there should be red dot.

Do the same for line 1 of `fastapp/__init__.py`

Now we can see the first file that gets executed when we run the app.

Restart the debugger. Play around with the action buttons until you understand what each does.

## Execution sequence

This will be a long and detailed section, feel free to take break before resuming.

We will now go through each step of the execution sequence and get familiar with the files while we're at it.

Execution sequence is roughly, "where in the code are we currently at?"

1. We run `$ poetry run python -m fastapp`

- `-m` means we run the fastapp module
- the folder `fastapp` is a module because there is an `__init__.py` file
- This is generally true, to make a folder a module you must put an `__init__.py` file in that folder

2. `fastapp/__init__.py`

- The `__init__.py` file of a module is first to run. There is no executable code here.

3. `fastapp/__main__.py`

- `__main__.py` is a special name, it defines the entry point for the package when it is executed as a script.
- Since we ran with the `-m` flag command, Python looks for a `__main__.py` file within the package directory and executes it. This allows you to define what should happen when the package is run directly.

Now, we wil look at the files in detail. The step numbers (1. 2. 3.) still apply.

To be accurate to the execution sequence, we will have to have jump between files.

Fortunately, this will be noted. i.e. Now find step "# 15.".

Now, look for "# 4."

```python
# fastapp/__main__.py

# 4. This import uvicorn is run
import uvicorn

# 5. We import this file, find "# 6." But, before you do, what find "# X." means
# is that the next line of code far below 'def main() -> None:' is NOT run
# because before we run that code, the import needs to finish first
# Ok, you're ready. Now actually find "# 6."
from fastapp.settings import settings

# 9. This code is defined
def main() -> None:
    """Entrypoint of the application."""
    # 11. we call this method
    uvicorn.run(
        # 12. We have referenced the fastapp module, fastapp/__init__.py is called again
        # find "# 13."
        "fastapp.web.application:get_app",
        workers=settings.workers_count,
        host=settings.host,
        port=settings.port,
        reload=settings.reload,
        log_level=settings.log_level.value.lower(),
        factory=True,
    ) # 21. Welcome back! You did it!
    # We will actually never reach this area until uvicorn exits / fails / quits
    # So unless a shutdown is signaled, this method never returns. But if it did,
    # look for "# 22. "

# 10. if statement below determines whether a Python script is being run as
# the main program or being imported as a module in another script.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # this code will execute because this is run as a main program
    main()
```

## Execution sequence summary

This summary is accurate as of now. As soon as imports change, it will not be.

Steps have been simplified and omitted

1. `$ poetry run python -m fastapp`
2. `fastapp/__init__.py`

- To load `fastapp` module. After it is done loading

3. `fastapp/__main__.py`

- Because of the `-m` flag

4. `fastapp/settings.py` loads due to `from fastapp.settings import settings`
5. Back to `fastapp/__main__.py`

- `uvicorn.run()` is called
- `"fastapp.web.application:get_app",` is referenced

6. `fastapp/web/application.py`

- `get_app` invoked, the return is an app

7. App gets returned and starts up
8. Life cycle method is called
9. App shuts down (error or manually)
10. Code after `yield` in `lifespan_setup` method of `fastapp/web/lifespan.py` file runs

That sequence was very complicated, but understanding is key as we add code to various portions of these steps.

Here is a helpful table

## Health router sequence

Here's an easy execution sequence trace.

By visiting [http://localhost:8000/api/docs](http://localhost:8000/api/docs) we can see the health endpoint

Which we can hit with `$ curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8000/api/health' -H 'accept: application/json'`

```python
# fastapp/web/api/monitoring/views.py
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/health")
def health_check() -> None:
    """
    Checks the health of a project.

    It returns 200 if the project is healthy.
    """
    print("hit")
```

When we do so the print is executed and we return from the method. None of the steps above come into play.

To wrap up, the code you just added should be exactly like [this PR](https://github.com/ryanzhou7/fastapp_course_v2/pull/1/files)
